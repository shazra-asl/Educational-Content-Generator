# Educational Content Generator with Fact Verification Using Generative AI

## Project Overview
This capstone project leverages generative AI to automate the creation of grade-appropriate educational content with verified facts. It addresses challenges in education such as the time-consuming content creation process, factual inaccuracies, and grade-level suitability. By integrating multiple generative AI capabilities, this project showcases a comprehensive solution for modern classrooms.

## Key Features
- **Google Search Grounding for Fact Verification:** Validates facts using real-time search results.
- **Structured Output for Consistency:** Ensures clear and readable formatting in generated content.
- **Grade-Level Appropriate Content Generation:** Tailors language complexity for middle-grade students.
- **Automated Quality Analysis:** Computes metrics such as reading level, fact density, and vocabulary complexity.
