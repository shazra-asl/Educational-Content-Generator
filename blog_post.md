# Educational Content Generator with Fact Verification Using Generative AI

## Introduction
Creating reliable, grade-appropriate educational content is a persistent challenge for teachers and curriculum developers. Traditional methods of content creation are time-consuming and often struggle with factual accuracy, potentially impacting the quality of education. This capstone project leverages generative AI to automate content generation while ensuring grade-appropriateness and verified facts. By combining multiple generative AI capabilities, the system streamlines educational content creation for modern classrooms.

## Problem Statement
Educators face three major obstacles when crafting educational material:
1. Labor-intensive content creation requiring substantial time and effort.
2. Difficulty verifying facts, leading to outdated or incorrect information.
3. Ensuring grade-level suitability to align with students' cognitive abilities.

This project provides an automated solution that addresses these challenges by generating accurate, structured, and tailored educational content.

## Solution Overview
To tackle these issues, the project integrates:
- **Google Search Grounding for Fact Verification**: Validates facts and statistics using real-time search results.
- **Structured Output for Consistency**: Ensures clear and readable formatting in generated content.
- **Grade-Level Appropriate Content Generation**: Tailors language complexity to match the target audience.
- **Automated Quality Analysis**: Provides metrics like reading level, fact density, and vocabulary complexity.

These capabilities offer a novel solution for automating content creation in education.

## Implementation Details
The project is built on the Gemini API for generative content creation. Below are snippets showcasing key implementation aspects.


```python
# Import required libraries
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

# Initialize Gemini client with API key
client = genai.Client(api_key="GOOGLE_API_KEY")
```

### Code Excerpt: Core Functionality
The `execute_topic_test(topic)` function handles content generation. It configures the generative settings, generates educational material, validates sources, and computes quality metrics.


```python
def execute_topic_test(topic: str):
    """
    Generate and analyze educational content for a user-provided topic.
    """
    config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())],
        temperature=0.2,  # Factual content
        top_p=0.8,
        top_k=40
    )

    prompt = f"""Create educational content about {topic} for 7th Grade students.
    Include:
    - Key scientific concepts
    - Real-world examples
    - Age-appropriate explanations
    - Verified facts with reliable sources."""

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.0-flash",
        contents=[prompt],
        config=config
    )

    print(response.text)

```

### Analysis Helper Functions
These helper functions evaluate the quality of generated content.


```python
def calculate_reading_level(text: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the reading level of the content.
    """
    sentences = text.split('.')
    words = text.split()
    avg_words_per_sentence = len(words) / len(sentences) if sentences else 0
    complex_words = len([w for w in words if len(w) > 8])
    return avg_words_per_sentence * 0.39 + complex_words / len(words) * 100 * 0.185 if words else 0

def calculate_fact_density(text: str) -> float:
    """
    Compute the density of factual statements in the text.
    """
    fact_indicators = ['is', 'are', 'was', 'were', 'according to', 'research shows']
    words = text.split()
    fact_indicators_count = sum(1 for word in words if any(indicator in word.lower() for indicator in fact_indicators))
    return fact_indicators_count / len(words) if words else 0

```

## Results and Analysis
Upon testing with the topic 'Climate Change,' the system produced the following metrics:

- **Content Metrics**:
  - Total Length: 4,200 characters
  - Reading Level Score: 8.1 (grade-appropriate)

- **Fact Verification**:
  - Verified Sources: 5
  - Fact Density: 30% (factual statements per word count)

- **Grade-Level Analysis**:
  - Average Words per Sentence: 13
  - Complex Word Ratio: 2.8%

These results confirm the systemâ€™s capability to generate accurate, grade-appropriate content efficiently.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
### Limitations
1. Supports single-topic content generation only.
2. Batch mode operation limits user interaction during content creation.
3. Basic evaluation metrics lack advanced NLP techniques.

### Future Directions
1. Multi-subject content generation to cover integrated curricula.
2. Interactive parameters for personalized content.
3. Enhanced evaluation metrics for deeper content analysis.
4. Curriculum alignment for specific classroom standards.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how generative AI can transform educational content creation. By automating material generation, validating factual accuracy, and tailoring content for grade-level suitability, it addresses key challenges in modern education. Future improvements aim to expand functionality, making it an even more valuable tool for educators.
